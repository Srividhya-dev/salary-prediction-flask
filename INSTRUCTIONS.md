Before running `app.py`, you need to place the trained model in the correct location.

## 📦 Download Trained Model

Due to GitHub size limits, the trained model file is hosted on Google Drive:

1. Download the model file from this link:  
   👉 [salary_prediction_model.joblib (Google Drive) present in ReadMe file

2. Move the file into your project’s **root directory**, the same folder where `app.py` is located.
